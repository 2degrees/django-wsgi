======================================
:mod:`webob.Request` objects in Django
======================================

*django-wsgi* extends Django's WSGI handler
(:class:`django.core.handlers.wsgi.WSGIHandler`) and the
:class:`~django.http.HttpRequest` class, so our handler uses our extended
request class.

As mentioned before, what Django calls "handler" is actually a generic WSGI
application that wraps your Django project. We'll stick to "WSGI application"
from now on.

This extended WSGI application offers a better WSGI support, as you would expect,
because the request class it uses borrows functionality from
:class:`webob.Request`. `WebOb <http://pythonpaste.org/webob/>`_ is another
popular component of the Paste project, which offers pythonic APIs to WSGI
requests (the so-called "WSGI environment") and responses, like
:class:`~django.http.HttpRequest` and :class:`~django.http.HttpResponse`,
but better:

- Django copies some values from the environment into its own request object,
  on every request, no matter if you are going to use them or not.
- When you edit a WebOb request, no matter what you do, your changes will be
  applied in the actual WSGI environment. This is key to interoperability.
- WebOb covers the environment comprehensively, with getters and other methods
  to make it easier and more fun to handle.
- Django refuses to read POST requests if the ``CONTENT_LENGTH`` equals ``"-1"``
  (may happen when read by WSGI middleware), while the intended behaviour
  is to **force** wrappers to read it.

:class:`Our new request class <django_wsgi.handler.DjangoWSGIRequest>` extends both
:class:`~django.http.HttpRequest` and :class:`webob.Request`, and because the
members of the former take precedence over the latter, it's 100%
compatible with the built-in request class in Django. :class:`webob.Response` is
not used in *django-wsgi*.

:class:`~django.http.HttpRequest` takes precedence even with the following
name clashes with :class:`webob.Request`:

- ``environ``. 
- ``path``.
- ``method``.
- ``POST``.
- ``GET``.

:class:`webob.Request`'s ``.POST`` and ``.GET`` are available as ``.uPOST`` and
``.uGET``, respectively. The other attributes are equivalent in both classes.

When you use this application, your views receive the request as an instance of
:class:`~django_wsgi.handler.DjangoWSGIRequest` automatically.

See the `API documentation for webob.Request
<http://pythonpaste.org/webob/class-webob.Request.html>`_ to meet the new
members of your request objects.


Using the WSGI application directly
-----------------------------------

You can import it as you would normally do in Django::

    from os import environ
    environ['DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE'] = "yourpackage.settings"
    
    from django_wsgi import DjangoApplication
